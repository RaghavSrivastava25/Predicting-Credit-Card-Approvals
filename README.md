# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Used the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Preprocessed the dataset to ensure that the machine learning model made good predictions.
After the data was in good shape, some exploratory data analysis to build my intuitions.
Finally, built a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
